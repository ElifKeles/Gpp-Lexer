# Gpp-Lexer
This homework contains two parts of lexer for a language G++. (First Flex, second lisp lexer.) 
Lexer accepts any set of valid expressions and rejects incorrect expressions. If the expressions are valid, lexer tokenizes the statements. Each lexer takes entries and an optional filename. 

To run flex: run the makefile, ./gpp_lexer.out (filename or entry)

And to run lisp: clisp gpp_lexer.lisp (filename or entry)
